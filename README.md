While examining these statistics is helpful, there are a couple more queries that would aid W. Avy in his decision. It'd be helpful to examine the wind speeds during these months to ensure business would stay consistent. Secondly, W. Avy would probably also like to know the tides since with no waves there would be no surfers.
